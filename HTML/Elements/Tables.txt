Basic structure of a table

<table>"....table content......</table> 
    - this table opening and closing tag creates a table. 
    - the table content is written row x row
    _ the start of row is indicated by the row tag

<tr>....row content....</tr>
    - this is a table row opening and closing tag
    - it contains row content which is referenced to as table data
    - row content is written in one row thus from left to right corresponding to the number of availale columns if any

<td>.....data...</td>
    - td refferes to to table data
    - the opening and closing tags of td holds the information that will be displayed on the browers
    - this is information of data inside the table

analogus to the HTML document structure, the table can be persived as:

                <html>                                           <table>
                                             <!--Meta data-->
                    <head>                                            <tr>
                        <title>....</title>                              <td>....</td>
                    </head>                                           </tr>
                </html>                                         </table>


                - html marks the start and ending of html document. In constrat, Table marks the start and end of table document
                - head and title || table raw an table data simply tell us about the document or rather the propertises of the elements making uo the documents and not the actuall content of the document
                - content in title || table data is what is dispalyed by the broswer and it is what is consumed by the user. 

<th>....Heading content....</th>
    - represents the heading of either a column or row - scope attribute can be used to indicate whether heading is for column or row 
                    <th scope="col" || scope="raw">.....</th>
    - it can span in column or in row
    - browser display it bold and middle of cell
    - has the same propertises as <td> except its a heading
    - helps screen readers, improves ability of SE to index page, enables appearance of table when appliying CSS
