        <p>A paragraph consists of one or more sentences that forms a <br>self-contained unit of discourse. The start of a paragraph is <br> indicated by a new line.</p>
        <p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up into units of <br> text. For example, a book may have chapters. Chapters can <br>have subheadings. Under each heading there will be one or <br>more paragraphs.</p>
