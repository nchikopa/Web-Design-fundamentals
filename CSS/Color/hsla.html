        <h2>The Composition of Seawater</h2>
        <p>Almost anything can be found in the Seawater. This includes dissolved minerals form Earth's crust as well as realeased from organisms. The most important componet of seawater that influences life forms are salinity, temperature, dissolved gasses (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutients, and pH. These elements vary in their composition as well as in their influence on marine life. </p>
